Stable stateful systems through modeling, linear types and simulation.

I like to use things that wake me up at 4am as rarely as possible.
Unfortunately, infrastructure vendors don't focus on reliability.
Even if a company gives reliability lip service, it's unlikely that they
use techniques like modeling or simulation to create a rock-solid core.
Let's just build an open-source distributed store that takes correctness
seriously at the local storage, sharding, and distributed transactional layers.

My goal: verify core lock-free and distributed algorithms in use
with [rsdb](http://github.com/spacejam/rsdb) and
[rasputin](http://github.com/disasters/rasputin) with TLA+. Write
an implementation in Rust. Use quickcheck and abstracted RPC/clocks
to simulate partitions and test correctness under failure conditions.

## here we go... jumping into pluscal

This is a summary of an example from
[a wonderful primer on TLA+](https://www.learntla.com/introduction/example/)...

The first thing to know is that there are two languages in play: pluscal and TLA.
We test models using `tlc`, which understands most of TLA (not infinite sets, maybe
other stuff). TLA started as a specification language, tlc came along later to
actually test it, and pluscal is a simpler language that can be transpiled into
TLA. Pluscal has two forms, `c` and `p`. They are functionally identical, but
`c` form uses braces and `p` form uses prolog/ruby-esque `begin` and `end`
statements that can be a little easier to spot errors with, in my opinion.

We're writing Pluscal in a TLA comment (block comments are written
with `(* <comment text> *)`), and when we run a translator like `pcal2tla`
it will insert TLA after the comment, in the same file.

```tla
------------------------------- MODULE pcal_intro -------------------------------
EXTENDS Naturals, TLC

(* --algorithm transfer
variables alice_account = 10, bob_account = 10,
          account_total = alice_account + bob_account

process TransProc \in 1..2
  variables money \in 1..20;
begin
  Transfer:
    if alice_account >= money then
      A: alice_account := alice_account - money;
      B: bob_account := bob_account + money;
    end if;
C: assert alice_account >= 0;
end process

end algorithm *)

\* this is a TLA comment. pcal2tla will insert the transpiled TLA here

MoneyInvariant == alice_account + bob_account = account_total

=============================================================================
```

This code specifies 3 global variables, `alice_account`, `bob_account`, `account_total`.
It specifies, using `process <name> \in 1..2` that it will run in two concurrent processes.
Each concurrent process has local state, `money`, which may take any initial value from
1 to 20, inclusive.  It defines steps `Transfer`, `A`, `B` and `C` which are evaluated as
atomic units, although they will be tested against all possible interleavings of execution.
All possible values will be tested.

Let's save the above example as `pcal_intro.tla`, transpile the pluscal comment to TLA,
then run it with tlc! (if you want to name it something else, update the MODULE
specification at the top)

```
pcal2tla pcal_intro.tla
tlc pcal_intro.tla
```

BOOM! This blows up because our transaction code sucks, big time. Looking at the trace
that tlc outputs, it shows us how alice's account may become negative. Because processes
1 and 2 execute the steps sequentially but with different interleavings, the algorithm
will check `alice_account >= money` before trying to transfer it to bob. By the time one
process subtracts the code from alice, however, the other process may have already done so.
We can specify that these steps and checks happen atomically by changing:

```
  Transfer:
    if alice_account >= money then
      A: alice_account := alice_account - money;
      B: bob_account := bob_account + money;
    end if;
```

to

```
  Transfer:
    if alice_account >= money then
      \* remove the labels A: and B:
      alice_account := alice_account - money;
      bob_account := bob_account + money;
    end if;
```

which means that the entire `Transfer` step is atomic. In reality, maybe this is done
by punting this atomicity requirement to a database transaction. Re-running tlc should
produce no errors now, because both processes atomically check + deduct + add balances
to the bank accounts without violating the assertion.

The invariants at the bottom are not actually being checked yet. They are specified in
TLA, not in the pluscal comment. They can be checked by creating a `pcal_intro.cfg` file
(or replace the one auto-generated by pcal2tla) with the following content:

```
SPECIFICATION Spec
INVARIANT MoneyInvariant
```

# lock-free algorithms for efficient local storage

In the interests of achieving a price-performance that is compelling,
we need to make this thing sympathetic to modern hardware. Check out
[Dmitry's wonderful blog](http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms)
for a fast overview of the important ideas here.

## lock-free ring buffer

The ring buffer is at the heart of several systems in our local storage system.
It serves as the core of our concurrent IO buffering and epoch-based GC for our
logical page ID allocator.

## lock-free list
The list allows us to CAS a partial update to a page into a chain, avoiding
the work of rewriting the entire page. To read a page, we traverse its list
until we learn about what we sought. Eventually, we need to compact the list
of partial updates to improve locality, probably around 4-8.

## lock-free stack
The stack allows us to maintain a free list of page identifiers. Our radix
tree needs to be very densely populated to achieve a favorable data to
pointer ratio, and by reusing page identifiers after they are freed, we
are able to keep it dense. Hence this stack. When we free a page, we push
its identifier into this stack for reuse.

## lock-free radix tree
We use a radix tree for maintaining our in-memory mapping from logical
page ID to its list of partial updates. A well-built radix tree can
achieve a .92 total size:data ratio when densely populated and using a
contiguous key range. This is way better than what we get with B+ trees,
which max out between .5-.6. The downside is that with low-density we
get extremely poor data:pointer ratios with a radix tree.

## lock-free IO buffer
We use a ring buffer to hold buffers for writing data onto the disk, along
with associated metadata about where on disk the buffer will end up.
This is fraught with peril. We need to avoid ABA problems in the CAS that
claims a particular buffer, and later relies on a particular log offset.
We also need to avoid creating a stall when all available buffers are
claimed, and a write depends on flushing the end of the buffer before the
beginning is free. Possible ways of avoiding: fail reservation attempts
when the buffer is full of claims, support growing the buffer when necessary.
Bandaid: don't seal entire buffer during commit of reservation.

## lock-free pagecache
Combines the radix tree, stack, and IO buffer to manage our state.
